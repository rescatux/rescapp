<h3>Problems that are usually solved</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Scenario 1: <b>Your former sysadmin disappears</b></p>
Your former sysadmin is no longer there. It doesn't matter if you have fired him and he's angry at you or if he had a fatal car accident. You need to take in control of your Business Windows server. You are also lucky because you have an account in your Business Windows server which you can login to.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>What do you get after using the option?</h3>
If everything goes ok the next time you boot your computer when Windows login appears you will be able to login with your account.
Now thanks to your account you can run programs which only Windows administrators can usually run.
