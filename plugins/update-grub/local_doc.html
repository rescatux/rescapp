<p><a name="english">Update GRUB Configuration File - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
</p>
<p>
Newest computers start up thanks to the newest (from 2015 onwards) UEFI boot system.
</p>
<p>
Older computers start up thanks to the old BIOS boot system.
</p>
<p>
Later on the boot process is delegated into GRUB. GRUB has its own menu system. You might be lacking some distributions entries or some Windows entries.
</p>
<p>
This option rescans your Operating Systems and updates the GRUB menu accordingly so that other distributions and Windows appear again.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for partitions, that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found, in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays a list of partitions, that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which GNU/Linux partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your main GNU/Linux distribution, (you will probably only see one), and press the OK button.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard drives present, on your system, based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>(NOTE: This step is automatically skipped if your system only has one hard disk.) <p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Order hard drives, according to boot order. Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at the hard drives and their sizes. Order them according, to the BIOS boot order and then press OK.
  </li>

  <li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to create a temporary device.map, on your Linux installation, (which will be deleted later), and try to update your grub configuration file, on your selected partition, thanks to your own distributions update-grub command.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>You are informed about the, grub configuration file update process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p>
  <div style="padding: 5px; border: 6px solid green; margin: 7px;">
  <p>
  <b>
  <IMG SRC="../not-documented/images/dialog-ok-apply.png">
  [SUCCESS] The grub configuration was updated OK! :)
  </b>
  </p>
  </div>
  or
  <div style="padding: 5px; border: 6px solid green; margin: 7px;">
  <p>
  <b>
  <IMG SRC="../not-documented/images/dialog-error.png">
  [ERROR] The grub configuration update failed! :(
  </b>
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>
</ul>
