<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searchs for hard drives on your computer.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such hard drives have been found, Rescapp displays a list of the drives. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which hard drive?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose the hard drive which has a GPT partition which you want to have a hybrid MBR on.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information is going to create a hybrid MBR on your GPT hard drive.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently in (Rescatux 0.40b1), this step is time consuming, but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are informed about the hybrid mbr creation process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Hybrid MBR was created OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Hybrid MBR was not created. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>A log file called <i>gpt-create-hybrid-mbr_log.txt</i> can be found in the Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
