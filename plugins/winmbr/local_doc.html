  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for primary partitions on your drive.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp displays a list of these partitions. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your Windows (you will probably only see one) and press the OK button. If you have several Windows partitions, the best Windows partition to choose, is the first one that you installed on your computer.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard drives present on your system based on the information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard drive do you want to install the Windows mbr on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to take a look at hard drive sizes (to be able to identify your hard drives) and choose (usually) the one that it is set to be the first one to boot in your BIOS settings.
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/winmbr_002_hard_disk.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>What is the correct position for this hard drive?</i><p></p> Just select the right boot order position for the prompted hard drive according to your BIOS settings.
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/winmbr_003_position_hard_disk.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all gathered information, is going to set up a Windows mbr on your chosen hard disk so that the partition you have chosen is booted at machine boot.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming, but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the mbr installation process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Windows mbr was installed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Windows mbr was not installed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/winmbr_004_sucess.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 8</b><p></p>A log file called <i>winmbr.log.txt</i> can be found in the Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
