  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for partitions, that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found, in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays a list of partitions, that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your main GNU/Linux distribution, (you will probably only see one), and press the OK button.

  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to create a temporary device.map, on your Linux installation, (which will be deleted later), and try to update your grub configuration file, on your selected hard drive, thanks to your own distributions update-grub command.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently with, (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming, but no Please wait message has been implemented.
