  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp then displays the partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (you probably will see only one) and press the OK button.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard drives present, on your system, based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard drive do you wish to install Grub on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to take a look at hard drive sizes (to be able to identify your hard drives), and choose (usually) the one that is set to be first one to boot in your BIOS settings.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Order hard drives according to boot order? Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at the hard drives and their sizes. Order them according to the BIOS boot order and then press OK.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is then going to create a temporary device.map on your Linux installation (which will be deleted later) and try to install grub on your selected hard drive, thanks to your own distributions grub-install command.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently on (Rescatux 0.23), this step is time consuming, but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the grub installation process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p><i>Grub was installed OK! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Grub was not installed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/grub-install_004_sucess.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 8</b><p></p>A log file called <i>grub-install.log.txt</i> can be found in the Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
</ul>
