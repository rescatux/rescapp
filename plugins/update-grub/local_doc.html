  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found Rescapp displays partitions that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose your main GNU/Linux distribution (you will probably only see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>

  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard drives present on your system based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Order the hard drives according to boot order? Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at the hard drives and their sizes. Order them according to the BIOS boot order and then press OK.

  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to create a temporary device.map on your Linux installation (which will be deleted later), and try to update your grub configuration file on your selected hard drive, thanks to your own distributions update-grub command.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently (Rescatux 0.23) this step is time consuming but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>You are informed about the grub configuration file update process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p><i>Success! Grub configuration was updated ok! :)</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! Grub configuration update went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>A log file called <i>update-grub.log.txt</i> can be found in the Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
